Astrolog for Android using Termux (v7.70)

Compiled from source for android with termux!

Requirements: aarch64 

Install with: dpkg -i Astrolog-7.70.deb

"deb" located in the release section of this page

Use the following switch if it cant find "ephem" files:

-Yi1 "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/ephem/"

Ive included a basic shell script in the source section to preview some features of the program after installing the deb package.

Thank you!
